# unnecessary.ai

üê≥ **hello!** We're a collective made up of fun-loving builders of artificial intelligence. 

***

**unnecessary.ai** was created to feature machine learning projects which capture the 
spirit of human creativity.

We're starting off by featuring projects built by our machine learning engineers 
in-house at [Dessa](http://dessa.com), but we'd love to spotlight projects from 
creators everywhere. 

**Interested in adding your unnecessary project to this page?** 
We welcome pull requests.
